# Introduction {#introduction}

## Welcome {#welcome}
Thank you for your interest in the childfree package! This vignette contains codebooks for dataframes created by the package's functions from publicly-accessible data. The [Introduction to Childfree](childfree.html) vignette provides a more general introduction.

The `childfree` package can be cited as:
