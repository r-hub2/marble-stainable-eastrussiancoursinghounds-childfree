\description{
Read and recode National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data
}
\details{
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm}{National Survey of Family Growth} (NSFG)
regularly collects fertility and other health information from a population-representative sample of adults in the
United States. Between 1973 and 2002, the NSFG was conducted periodically. Starting in 2006, the NSFG transitioned to
continuous data collection, releasing data in multi-year waves (e.g., 2006-2010, 2011-2013). The \code{nsfg()} function reads
the raw data from CDC's website, extracts and recodes selected variables useful for studying childfree adults and other family
statuses, then returns either an unweighted data frame, or a weighted design object that can be analyzed using the \code{\link{survey}}
package.

\strong{Sampling weights}

The NSFG is collected using a complex survey design. The \code{survey} package can be used to perform analyses that take these
design features into account, and make it possible to obtain population-representative estimates. In most cases, a \link[survey]{svydesign}
object for a single wave can be created using \code{survey::svydesign(data = data, ids = ~cluster, strata = ~strata, weights = ~weight, nest = TRUE)}.
Additional information about analyzing DHS data using weights is available \href{https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm}{here}.

\strong{Non-biological children}

When \code{nonbio == TRUE} (default), non-biological children (e.g., adopted children, foster children, etc.) are treated the same as
biological children when determining a respondent's family status. This matches the approach described by the ABC Framework
(Neal & Neal, 2024), and should generally be used.However, non-biological children can be ignored by setting \code{nonbio = FALSE},
which may be useful when comparing NSFG estimates to estimates derived from other data where information about non-biological children
is not available.

\strong{Additional notes}
\itemize{
\item Starting in 2006, "hispanic" was a response option for race, however "hispanic" is not a racial category, but an ethnicity.
When a respondent chose this option, their actual race is unknown.
\item Partnership status only describes a respondent's status with respect to an opposite-sex partner. Information about current
or former same-sex partnerships is not available.
\item The NSFG manual explains that "sample sizes for a single year are too small to provide estimates with adequate levels of precision,"
and therefore recommends avoiding analysis of data from single years. Instead, these data are designed to be analyzed by wave.
